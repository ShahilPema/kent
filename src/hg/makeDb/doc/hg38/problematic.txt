These alternative loci scaffolds (such as KI270794.1 in the hg38 assembly, referenced as chr5_KI270794v1_alt in the browser), are mapped to the genome and provide suppemental genomic information on these variable locations. To find the regions these alternate sequences correspond to in the genome you may use the Alt Haplotypes track if one is available.
