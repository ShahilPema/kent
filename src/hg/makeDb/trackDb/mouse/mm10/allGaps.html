<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows all gaps (any sequence of N's) in the Dec. 2011
<em>Mus musculus</em>/GRCm38/mm10 genome assembly.  Not all gaps were
annotated in the AGP file, this track includes all sequences of N's in
the assembly.
</p>
<p>
Genome assembly procedures are covered in the NCBI
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/basics/"
target=_blank>assembly documentation</a>.<BR>
NCBI also provides
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000001635.26"
target="_blank">specific information about this assembly</a>.
</p>
<p>
Any sequence of N's in the assembly is marked as a gap in this track.
The standard gap track only shows the gaps as annotated in the AGP file:
<a href="https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/bigZips/p6/mm109.p6.agp.gz" target=_blank>mm10.p6.agp.gz</a><br>
The NCBI document
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/agp/AGP_Specification/"
target=_blank>AGP Specification</a> describes the format of the AGP file.

<p>
Gaps are represented as black boxes in this track.
There is no information in this track about order or orientation
of the contigs on either side of the gap.
