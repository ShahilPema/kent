<P>
<p>This track shows data from Sergei Pond's research group, updated several
times between 2020 and 2022, with results published in 2022. The current
dataset is from February 2022 and is scheduled to be updated soon. Contact us
or Sergei if you believe that the data shown is too outdated for your analyses.

<p>The authors use several statistical techniques to identify selection sites
of interest in SARS-CoV-2 data from <a target="_blank"

</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
 
<p>
This track has two subtracks:
</p>

<p><b>Positive Selection:</b> &quot;On average along interior 
tree branches, this site has a dN/dS&gt;1 is accumulating non-synonymous changes (some 
of which might have a functional impact, but most probably don't) faster 
relative to synonymous changes than would be expected under neutral evolution.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Negative Selection:</b> &quot;On average along interior 
tree branches, this site has a dN/dS&lt;1, meaning that it is conserved, i.e. 
non-synonymous changes might be selected against. Note that sites with no 
changes (i.e. perfectly conserved sites) cannot be detected by dN/dS based methods&quot;</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The CSV used to generate the genomic coordinates of selection sites was parsed 
and the position, gene, site_in_gene, score, and type fields were used to 
generate the resulting fields provided for each site in the data.</p>
