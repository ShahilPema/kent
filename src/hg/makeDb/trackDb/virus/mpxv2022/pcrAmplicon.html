<h2>Description</h2>

<p> This track shows the amplicons and primers for the 
  <a href="https://www.protocols.io/view/monkeypox-virus-multiplexed-pcr-amplicon-sequencin-5qpvob1nbl4o/v2"
     target="_blank">PrimalSeq V2</a> PCR amplification assay.
PrimalSeq is a primer scheme for MPXV. Based on initial validation, the
 approach shows notably higher depth and breadth of coverage across the genome,
 particularly with higher PCR cycle threshold (Ct) samples, as compared to
 metagenomic sequencing.  </p>
 <p>
 While the primers were designed for the pre-outbreak sequence MT903345, there
 is no single mismatch in any primer against the Rivers reference assembly.</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>
Genomic locations of the amplicons are highlighted. Thick rectangles indicate the primers, intervening amplicon sequence is shown with lines and arrows. A click on the amplicons shows both primer sequences. 
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
Primer sequences and names were
<a href="https://www.protocols.io/view/monkeypox-virus-multiplexed-pcr-amplicon-sequencin-5qpvob1nbl4o/v2/materials"
   target=_blank>downloaded from protocols.io</a>, aligned to the Rivers reference with BLAT and
converted from PSL to bigBed.
</p>

<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>
The raw data can be explored interactively with the
<a href="hgTables">Table Browser</a> or combined with other datasets in the
<a href="hgIntegrator">Data Integrator</a> tool.
For automated analysis, the genome annotation is stored in
a bigBed file that can be downloaded from
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/mpxvRivers/pcrAmplicon/pcrAmplicon.bb">the download server</a>.</p>
<p>
Annotations can
be converted from binary to ASCII text by our command-line tool bigBedToBed.
Instructions for downloading this command can be found on our
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#utilities_downloads">utilities page</a>.
The tool can also be used to obtain features within a given range without downloading the file,
for example:</p>
<code>bigBedToBed http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/mpxvRivers/pcrAmplicon/pcrAmplicon.bb -chrom=NC_063383.1 -start=0 -end=100000 stdout</code>
