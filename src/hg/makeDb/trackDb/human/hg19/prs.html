<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The Polygenic Risk Scores eMERGE track shows variants that are part of selected
polygenic risk scores for 10 common diseases. The risk scores were selected by the <a
href="https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/Electronic-Medical-Records-and-Genomics-Network-eMERGE"
target="_blank">NHGRI eMERGE project</a>. Many PRS models were evaluated and
the 10 ones shown here were selected based on quality. The selection process is
described in <a href='#ref'>Lennon et al. 2023</a>.

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
Text files provided by eMerge were converted to bigBed format. The scripts are available in our <a target=_blank href='https://github.com/ucscGenomeBrowser/kent/blob/master/src/hg/makeDb/scripts/prsEmerge'>GitHub repo</a>.
</p>

<H2>Data access</H2>
<p>
The raw data can be explored interactively with the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgTables">Table Browser</a>
or the <a href="../cgi-bin/hgIntegrator">Data Integrator</a>. The data can be
accessed from scripts through our <a href="https://api.genome.ucsc.edu">API</a>, the track name
is "prsEmerge".
</p>

<p>
For automated download and analysis, the genome annotations are stored in files that
can be downloaded from
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/$db/prsEmerge" target="_blank">our download server</a>.
The data is stored in our <a href='../goldenPath/help/bigBed.html'>bigBed</a> format. Individual
regions or the whole genome annotation can be obtained using our tool <tt>bigBedToBed</tt>
which can be compiled from the source code or downloaded as a precompiled
binary for your system. Instructions for downloading source code and binaries can be found
<a href="http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#utilities_downloads">here</a>.
The tool
can be used to obtain all features or only features within a given range, e.g. 
<tt>bigBedToBed http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/hg19/prsEmerge/t2d.bb -chrom=chr21 -start=0 -end=100000000 stdout</tt></p>
